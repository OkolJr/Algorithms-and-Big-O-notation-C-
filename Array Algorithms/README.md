<h1>Array Data Structure Guide</h1>
<h3>What is an Array? </h3>
An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations. It’s one of the most popular and simple data structures and is often used to implement other data structures. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0 . Each element in an array is accessed through its index.

<h3>Need of Array Data Structures</h3>
Arrays are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including:<ul>
<li>Storing data for processing</li>
<li>Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues</li>
<li>Representing data in tables and matrices</li>
<li>Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Array</h3>
There are two main types of arrays:<ul>
<li>One-dimensional arrays: These arrays store a single row of elements.</li>
<li>Multidimensional arrays: These arrays store multiple rows of elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Array Operations</h3>
Common operations performed on arrays include:<ul>
<li>Traversal : Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g., sequential, reverse).</li>
<li>Insertion : Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.</li>
<li>Deletion : Removing an element from an array at a specific index.</li>
<li>Searching : Finding the index of an element in an array.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Applications of Array</h3>

</ul>
<h2>All Array Algorithms</h2>
<h3>Equilibrium index of an array</h3>
Given an array arr[] of size n, return an equilibrium index (if any) or -1 if no equilibrium index exists. The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes equals the sum of elements at higher indexes.<br>
Note: Return equilibrium point in 1-based indexing. Return -1 if no such point exists. 
<h3>Find the Missing Number</h3>
Given an array arr[] of size N-1 with integers in the range of [1, N], the task is to find the missing number from the first N integers.<br>
Note: There are no duplicates in the list.
<h3>K’th Smallest Element in Unsorted Array</h3>
Given an array arr[] of N distinct elements and a number K, where K is smaller than the size of the array. Find the K’th smallest element in the given array.
<h3>Leaders in an array</h3>
Write a program to print all the Leaders in the array. An element is a Leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.<br>
Note: The rightmost element is always a leader.
<h3>Maximum Length Bitonic Subarray</h3>
Given an array A[0 … n-1] containing n positive integers, a subarray A[i … j] is bitonic if there is a k with i <= k <= j such that A[i] <= A[i + 1] … = A[k + 1] >= .. A[j – 1] > = A[j]. Write a function that takes an array as argument and returns the length of the maximum length bitonic subarray. 
Expected time complexity of the solution is O(n)
<h3>Maximum Product Subarray</h3>
Given an integer array, the task is to find the maximum product of any subarray.
<h3>Maximum Subarray Sum</h3>
Given an array arr[], the task is to find the subarray that has the maximum sum and return its sum.
<h3>Minimum Platforms Required for Given Arrival and Departure Times</h3>
We are given two arrays that represent the arrival and departure times of trains, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required so that no train waits.
<h3>Print array after it is right rotated K times</h3>
Given an Array of size N and a value K, around which we need to right rotate the array. How do you quickly print the right rotated array?
<h3>Trapping Rain Water Problem</h3>
Trapping Rainwater Problem states that given an array of N non-negative integers arr[] representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after rain.
