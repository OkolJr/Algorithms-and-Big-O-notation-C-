# Algorithms and Big O notation C#
Cheat sheet for understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms  Big O notation describes the complexity of code using algebraic terms(time and space)  O(n log(n)), also known as loglinear complexity, means that log(n) operations will occur n times. Itâ€™s commonly used in recursive sorting algorithms and binary tree sorting algorithms
This is all just an expiriment of sorts to practice my knowledge of algorithms.
